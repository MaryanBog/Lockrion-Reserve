# Lockrion Reserve (LRV)
## Treasury Charter v1.0

---

## 1. Purpose

Lockrion Reserve (LRV) is a managed digital treasury structure operating with a fixed token supply and dynamically controlled circulation.

The purpose of LRV is:

- To maintain a transparent, managed crypto asset treasury.
- To structurally regulate circulating supply in alignment with treasury assets.
- To allocate capital periodically into deterministic issuance structures via the Lockrion protocol.

LRV does not represent:

- Equity or ownership rights.
- Revenue sharing entitlement.
- Dividend rights.
- Governance participation.
- Legal claim over underlying assets.

LRV represents participation within a transparent, managed treasury framework.

## 2. Token Structure

### 2.1 Fixed Supply

S_total = 10,000,000 LRV

- Total supply is fixed.
- Minting is permanently disabled.
- Burning is permanently disabled.
- No inflation mechanism exists.

### 2.2 Circulation Model

S_circ ≈ A_total

Where:

- S_circ = circulating LRV tokens.
- A_total = total number of asset units held in the treasury.
- Allowed tolerance: ±20 units.

Vault balance is defined as:

S_vault = S_total − S_circ

The vault holds non-circulating LRV tokens.

## 3. Treasury Structure

### 3.1 Asset Categories

Treasury assets may include:

- Stablecoins
- Major digital assets
- Publicly tradable crypto assets

### 3.2 Stable Buffer Requirement

Stable Share ≥ 25% of Total Portfolio Value

If the stable allocation falls below 25%:

- Circulation expansion is prohibited.
- Only rebalancing operations are permitted.

---

## 4. Circulation Expansion and Contraction

### 4.1 Expansion Constraint

Delta S_circ ≤ 5% per calendar month

Expansion is permitted only through:

- Sale of LRV tokens
- Acquisition of treasury assets

### 4.2 Contraction Mechanism

Contraction is executed through:

- Sale of treasury assets
- Market buyback of LRV tokens

No automatic mechanisms exist.
All actions are discretionary and manually executed.

---

## 5. Monthly Capital Allocation Mechanism

Monthly Release = k × Avg(Portfolio Value_last_90_days)

Where:

- k is between 0.5% and 1.5%
- Default value: k = 1%
- Avg(Portfolio Value_last_90_days) is the 90-day rolling average of total treasury value

Released capital is deployed exclusively via Lockrion deterministic issuance structures.

Parameter k may be adjusted no more than once per quarter.

---

## 6. Management Model

- Treasury management is centralized.
- LRV grants no governance rights.
- All treasury addresses are publicly disclosed.
- Portfolio composition is verifiable on-chain.
- Circulation and asset alignment are publicly auditable.

Transparency is prioritized over automation.

---

## 7. Risk Framework

LRV is exposed to:

- Market volatility
- Liquidity constraints
- Reflexive price dynamics
- Simultaneous portfolio drawdowns
- Stablecoin counterparty risk

No price stabilization guarantee is provided.
No obligation exists to defend market price.

---

## 8. Structural Principles

1. No supply inflation.
2. No algorithmic stabilization.
3. No automatic liquidation.
4. No guaranteed returns.
5. Manual, disciplined treasury management.
6. Full on-chain transparency.

---

## 9. Relationship to Lockrion

LRV operates independently from the Lockrion protocol.

Lockrion functions as a deterministic issuance infrastructure.
LRV may allocate capital into Lockrion structures but does not control or govern the protocol.
